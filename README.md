<h1>CY</h1>

An utility library for C++.
</div>

----------

### Features
1. Custom typenames.
2. A value/none (``Some<T>/None``) class implementation (``Maybe<T>``).
3. A value/error (``Ok<T>/Err<E>``) class implementation (``Result<T, E>``)

### Usage
Since CY is just header files, you can clone this repo (or download the source code) and include the `include/` directoy in your project's search paths.

If you want to try the tests (which are used to debug CY) you can use cmake to compile them.
